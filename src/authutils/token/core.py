    Validate the encoded JWT ``encoded_token``, which must satisfy the

    This is just a slightly lower-level function to decode the token and

    - Decode JWT using public key; PyJWT will fail if iat or exp fields are
      invalid
    - PyJWT will NOT fail if the aud field is present in the JWT but no
      ``aud`` arg is passed, or if the ``aud`` arg does not match one of
      the items in the token aud field, because the audience is not validated
      anymore
    - Check issuers: token iss field must match one of the items in the
      ``issuers`` arg
    - Check scopes: token scopes must be a superset of required scopes
      (the ``scope`` argument); fail if not satisfied
